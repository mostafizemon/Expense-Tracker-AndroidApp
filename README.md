I am excited to share the details of my latest project: an Android-based Expense Tracker app designed to help users efficiently manage their finances. This app incorporates various features to provide a comprehensive financial tracking experience.

Transaction Management:
Add, edit, and delete income and expense transactions effortlessly.
Transactions include details such as category, description, amount, and date.

A dedicated RecentFragment displays the 10 most recent transactions, both expenses, and incomes.
Users can edit these recent transactions directly from the RecentFragment.

Category-Based Summaries:
Summarizes expenses and incomes by category, providing users with insights into their spending and earning patterns.
A segmented control switch allows users to toggle between expense and income summaries.

Future enhancements to expand the editing capabilities beyond the most recent 10 items.
